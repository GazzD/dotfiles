These are the configs I use every day on:

- Arch Linux + Hyprland
- Windows (Komorebi + YASB + terminal/editor tooling)

This repository is intentionally split by platform so each setup is easier to navigate and maintain.

## Structure

```text
.
├── linux/     # Arch Linux + Hyprland setup
└── windows/   # Windows setup
```

## Where things live

- 🐧 Arch Linux (btw) + Hyprland setup: see [linux/README.md](linux/README.md)
- 🪟 Windows setup: see [windows/README.md](windows/README.md)

## Notes

- This repo is a real-world personal setup, not a one-click installer.
- Copy/symlink only the parts you need. I will try to improve the descriptions of each part of the setup
- Paths and app availability can differ by machine.
